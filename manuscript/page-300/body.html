<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> That was the near, big one Tannery, the old huge house, where on semi-dark floors the big ones Skins hung where there were concealed pits and forbidden passages in the cellar and where in the evening Liese told all the children her fairy tales. It went there quieter, friendlier and more human than in the hawk over there, but no less puzzling. The ruling of the Gerbergesellen in The pits, in the basement, in the garden and on the screeds was strange and peculiarly, the large yawning rooms were silent and as well attractive and uncanny, the mighty and surly master of the house became like a man-eater feared and shied and the liese went in the strange house like a fairy, all children, birds, cats and Little dog a protector and mother, full of kindness and full of miraculous fairy tales and song verses.</p></div> </div>
