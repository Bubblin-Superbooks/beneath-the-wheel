<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The honorable showpieces of a parish library, the Bengel, Ötinger, Steinhofer together with pious song singers, which Mörike im "Turmhahn" sings so beautifully and warmly, was missing here or disappeared in the crowd of modern works. All in all, together Magazine folders, standing desk and large, leaf-strewn desk looked scholar and serious. One got the impression that there was a lot here to work. And a lot of work was done here too, of course less in sermons, catechesis, and bible studies than in examinations and articles for scholarly journals and preliminary studies on own books. The dreamy mysticism and thoughtful pondering was from this place the naive theology of the heart, which was overruled by the Thunder of science, the thirsty folk soul in love and appeals to pity.</p></div> </div>
