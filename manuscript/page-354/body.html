He sat down on the parapet and listened on the water that rubbed against the pillars and roared at the weir and on MÃ¼hlrechen orgelte. His hands were cold, worked in the chest and throat halting and rushing the blood, his eyes darkened and rushed back to the heart in a sudden wave, his head full of dizziness leaving.</p><p>He came home, found his room, lay down and slept at once Entering in the dream from depth to depth through immense spaces. Around At midnight he awoke tormented and exhausted and lay down to the Morning between sleep and waking, from a thirsting yearning fulfilled, thrown back and forth by uncontrolled forces, right up to the first morning all his agony and affliction in a long crying broke out and he fell asleep on tear-wet pillows again.</p></div> </div>
