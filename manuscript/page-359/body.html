Waking up, he found himself alone, the loneliness of the cool Autumn nights embraced, longed for his girl and squeezed moaning in tear-off pillows.</p><p>The Friday on which he was to enter the mechanic workshop came closer.

When he is at Schoolhouse, at the dwelling of the rector or the computing teacher, at the Flaig's workshop or past the parsonage became miserable feel. So much plague, diligence and sweat, so much surrendered little ones Delights, so much pride and ambition and hopeful dreams, everything in vain, all so that he now, later than all comrades and from laughed at everyone, as the smallest Lehrbub could go to a workshop!</p></div> </div>
