<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Hans felt a small glass in his hand. He spilled a lot of it, he swallowed the rest and felt him burn like fire in the pit. On violent disgust shook him. He staggered down the porch steps alone he did not know how to get out of the village. Houses, fences and gardens turned crookedly and confused past him.</p><p>Under an apple tree he lay down in the wet meadow. A lot of disgusting feelings, agonizing fears and half-finished thoughts prevented him from falling asleep. He felt soiled and disgraced. How was he supposed to come home? What should he say to the father? And what should be out of it tomorrow? He felt so broken and miserable as if he had to rest for an eternity, sleep, be ashamed. Head and Eyes hurt him and he did not even feel that much power to get up and move on.</p></div> </div>
