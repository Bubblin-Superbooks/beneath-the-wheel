<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The mirror of the river flickered blue, gold and white, through the almost completely leafy maples and acacias of street alleys warmed one mild October sun down, the high sky was cloudless light blue. It was one of the quiet, pure and friendly autumn days on which everything beautiful of the past summer like a careless, smiling one Memory fulfills the mild air that the children use the season forget and think they have to look for flowers and those old ones Little men and women with musing eyes from the window or from the window Bank in front of the house to look into the air, because it seems to them, the friendly memories not only of the year, but of their whole Expired life flies visibly through the clear blueness.</p></div> </div>
