The slats flew apart, the Nails bent crunching, a little rotten rabbit food, still from the last summer, came to light.

He jumped over to the loose, floating trunks, lay down on a willow pile and tried to imagine that Raft on the way, drive soon quickly, now reluctantly on meadows, fields, Villages and cool forest edges past, under bridges and reared Stellfallen through, and he lay on it and everything would be like usual, since he still brought hare feed on the Kapfberg, in the Gerbergärten on the bank Angling and still no headache and no worries.</p>",

Cork pieces and quills in all shapes and sizes were sampled or newly carved, small Weighted pieces of lead of different weights hammered into balls and with Provided incisions, to weight the cords.

He stopped at the upper embankment and pulled a round tin box from his trouser pocket and began diligently To catch grasshoppers.

He tugged a little At that, let him go again, tasted again. Now he bit - that a good fisherman feels through string and stick in his fingers twitch! Hans did an artificial jerk and started cautiously pull. The fish was sitting, and when it became visible, Hans realized Roach. They are known by their broad, yellowish-yellow shimmering Body, at the triangular head and especially at the beautiful, flesh-red Approach of the pelvic fins.</p>",
  "page-76": "<p> How hard could he be? But before he does it the fish did a desperate stroke, whirling fearful over the water surface and escaped.

He could only do it through the Teeth and only quiet, but for home use that was enough and now Nobody could hear him. The others were at school now had geography, only he alone was free and dismissed. He had her outdated, they were now under him. They had plagued him enough because he has no friendships except August and at their brawls and Play had not been a right joy.

Just a few little boys were on the bathing meadow, the larger ones were all in the School and Hans allowed it from their hearts. Nice, he pulled the Clothes off and got into the water. He understood it, heat and cooling to enjoy changing soon he swam a piece and dived and he splashed, and soon he lay on his stomach, feeling fast on the shore drying skin the sun glow. The little boys sneaked respectful of him. Yes, he had become a celebrity. And He looked so different from the rest.

The babbling and shouting was great, and the the entire width of the river shone bright, wet, naked bodies.</p><p>After an hour, Hans left. It came the warm evening hours, where bite the fish again. He fished on the bridge until dinner and caught next to nothing. The fish were greedy behind the fishing rod The bait was eaten away at any moment, but nothing remained hang.

The water lay black and silent under the bridge, in The lower mill was already light. Chatter and singing ran over bridges and alleys, the air was a little humid, and all jumped in the river A dark fish with a short blow in the air. At such Evenings, the fish are strangely excited, zigzagging and shooting They fly into the air, bang on the fishing line and fall blindly on the bait.</p>",
  "page-87": "<p> As the last piece of cheese Hans had extracted four smaller carp; the He wanted to bring the parish priest tomorrow.</p><p>A warm wind went down the valley. It was dark, but the sky was still light. From the whole darkening town rose only the church tower and the castle roof black and sharp in the light height. Quite in the Far away it had to thunder somewhere, sometimes one heard a gentle, wide distant thunder.</p><p>When Hans got into bed at ten o'clock he was in his head and limbs pleasantly tired and sleepy like a long time ago. A long row beautiful, free summer days lay calming and tempting in front of him, days to fool, to balk, to do, dreaming. Only one thing bitched him, that he had not completely become first.</p>",

All in all, together Magazine folders, standing desk and large, leaf-strewn desk looked scholar and serious. One got the impression that there was a lot here to work. And a lot of work was done here too, of course less in sermons, catechesis, and bible studies than in examinations and articles for scholarly journals and preliminary studies on own books. The dreamy mysticism and thoughtful pondering was from this place the naive theology of the heart, which was overruled by the Thunder of science, the thirsty folk soul in love and appeals to pity.</p>",
  "page-91": "<p> Instead, Bible criticism was zealous here driven and searched for the \"historical Christ\", who gave the modern theologians are like water from the mouth, but also like an eel slides through your fingers.</p><p>It is no different in theology than elsewhere. There is a Theology, that is art, and another, that is science or at least strives to be it. It was like today, and always the scientists on the new hoses have the old wine failed, but the artists, careless with some outward Forgetting error, comforters and joy-bearers have been for many. It is the old, unequal struggle between criticism and creation, Science and art, which is always right, without anyone but that would serve the seeds of faith, the Love, consolation, and beauty and eternity triviality and throw out always finds good ground. Because life is stronger than death, and faith is more powerful than doubt.</p>",
  "page-92": "<p>For the first time Hans was sitting on the small leather sofa between standing desk and Window. The parish priest was extremely friendly. Very comradely he told me about the seminar and how to live and study there.</p><p>\"The most important new thing,\" he concluded, \"is what you will experience there, is the introduction to the New Testament Greek. It will be you one new world, rich in work and joy. In the beginning, the Language trouble you; this is no longer Attic Greek, but a new idiom created by a new spirit. «</p><p>Hans listened attentively and felt proud of the true Science approached.</p><p>\"The school introduction to this new world,\" said the city pastor Of course, \"she takes some of her charm, of course. Also, you will be in At first, the Hebrew term may be too one-sided to take. If you feel like it, we could do one during this vacation make a small start.</p>",
  "page-93": "<p> In the seminar you will be glad then, time and To reserve power for other things. We could do a few chapters of Luke reading together, and you would be playing the language almost casually learn. I can lend you a dictionary. You would get one daily Hour, two at the most. More of course not, because before In the meantime, you must have your deserved rest now. Of course that is Just a suggestion - I do not want you the nice holiday feeling spoil it. \"</p><p>Of course Hans agreed. To be sure, this hatchet appeared to him like one slight cloud in the merry blue sky of his freedom, yet he was ashamed to refuse. And a new language so during the holidays in addition to learning was certainly more pleasure than work. Before the many new, that In the seminary, he had a slight fear anyway, especially before the Hebrew.</p>",
  "page-94": "<p>Not unsatisfied, he left the city pastor and beat himself through the Larch path uphill in the forest. The little displeasure was already gone, and the more he thought about it, the more acceptable it came to him in front. For he knew that he would be even more ambitious in the seminar would have to work tougher if he left his comrades behind wanted. And he wanted that decided. Why? He knew that not yourself. For three years, he was attentive to him, had the Teacher, the city pastor, the father and in particular the rector him spurred on and spiked in breath. The whole long time, from Class to class, he had been undisputed Primus. And now he had Gradually, he himself set his pride to be on top and none to tolerate next to yourself.

In the seminar I have to learn it anyway. \"</p>",

While he's the golden book title When he looked at it, the shoemaker's speeches made him think. Such remarks on the city pastor and the newfangled He had often heard clergy before. But he felt now for the first time with suspense and curiosity into these things drawn. As important and terrible as the shoemaker they were to him not, rather, he sensed the possibility here, behind old, big ones Secrets to penetrate. In the earlier years of his studies, he had the Questions about God's omnipresence, about the whereabouts of souls Devil and hell here and there aroused fantastic musings, nevertheless It was all that in the last years of hard work and hard work fell asleep, and his scholastic Christian faith was only in Conversations with the shoemaker occasionally to some personal Life woke up.</p>",

The cobbler's tart, acquired in bitter years strength the boy could not understand, and besides, Flaig was one indeed clever, but simple and one-sided man, for many reasons mocked by his piety. In the meetings of the hour brothers stepped he as a severe fraternal judge and as a mighty interpreter of the Holy Scripture, kept his in the villages around Building hours, but otherwise he was just a little craftsman and limited like all others. The parish priest, on the other hand, was not just one clever, well-meaning man and preacher, but also one diligent and stern scholar.

The one in the fear and in the triumph of the exam Submerged ambition was awake again, leaving him no peace. at the same time Again the peculiar feeling in the head began to stir, which he in had felt so often in the past few months - no pain, but one hastily triumphant rush of accelerated pulses and violent agitated forces, a hastily impetuous forward request.</p>",

Of the Man, as nature creates him, is something unpredictable, Opaque, hostile. He is one of unknown mountains breaking stream and is a jungle without a path and order. And like one Jungle must be cleared and purified and forcibly restricted, so the school must crush the natural man, defeat it and forcibly restrict; her job is to follow him authority approved principles to a useful link to make society and to awaken the qualities in it, whose complete training then crowned the careful breeding of the barracks quits.</p>",

It was bitter, in the middle of the hot afternoon instead of the Badwiese to go into the warm room of the professor and in the dusty, back-filled air with a tired head and a dry voice to proclaim the ^ a plus b ^ and ^ a minus b ^. It was then something paralyzing and very oppressive in the air, which on bad days turns into Despair and despair could transform. With mathematics he felt strange at all.

For the same reason he liked Latin so much, because This language is clear, safe, unique and knows almost nothing Doubt. But if all results were correct in arithmetic, it came but actually nothing right out. The mathematical works and lessons seemed like walking on a level Highway; You always come forward, you understand something every day you did not understand yesterday, but you never came to a mountain where suddenly wide prospects opened up.</p><p>The rector was a little more lively during the lessons. of course Understand the city pastor from the degenerate Greek of the new Testamentes still something much more attractive and more magnificent make as those from the youthful Homeric language.</p>",

About the round, the beautifully arched hill ran like a thin, light wave the germinating Green, the trees laid their winter form, the brown network with the sharp outlines, and lost with a young game of leaves into each other and into the colors of the landscape, as an unlimited, flowing wave of living green.</p>",

Now he made no effort to the bird species distinguish or recognize the shrubs on their buds. He saw only the general bustle, the everywhere sprouting colors, breathed Smell of young foliage, felt the softer and fermenting air and left surprised by the fields. He tired soon, always had a passion to lie down and fall asleep and almost constantly saw other things Things that really surrounded him. What things were, he did not know himself, and he did not think about it. They were bright, delicate, unusual dreams that make him look like portraits or avenues strange trees stood around without anything happening in them.</p>",

It was a walk on foreign earth, on one soft, pleasant to the ground, and it was a breathing stranger Air, an air full of lightness and fine, dreamy spice. At Occasionally these images also had a feeling of being dark, warm and exciting, as if a light hand glided over him with a soft touch the body.</p><p>Hans had a great deal of trouble reading and working to be attentive. What did not interest him, slipped away shadowy under his hands and he had to use the Hebrew vocabulary if he still had it in the lesson wanted to know, only in the last half hour to learn.</p>",

In the middle of a lesson or at He sometimes read his father or old Anna or one his former teacher or classmate, was visible in front of him and took all his attention for a while.

His friend was remarkably quiet; he let him talk, nodded here and there or did with his little ruler, with which he had to play a long thoughtful day, a few thoughtful blows in the Air. Gradually Hans fell silent too; it had become night and she sat on the ledges of a window.</p><p>\"You, Hans?\" Heilner finally began. His voice was uncertain and excited.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"Oh nothing.\"</p><p>\"No, just talk!\"</p><p>\"I just thought-because you told so many things-\"</p>",
  "page-246": "<p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"Tell me, Hans, have not you ever run after a girl?\"</p><p>There was a silence. They had never talked about that before.

The teachers started to get angry Cut faces and shoot odd looks, the Ephorus was dark and annoying and even the classmates had long noticed that Giebenrath had sunk from its height and ceased to To aim at Primus. Only Heilner did not notice, since he himself had school was not particularly important, and Hans himself saw everything happen and to change without paying attention.</p>",
  "page-249": "<p>Heilner meanwhile got fed up with newspaper editing and completely returned to his friend. In spite of the prohibition accompanied He Hans several times on his daily walk, lay with him in the Sun and dreamed, reading poems or making jokes about the Ephorus.

This time he left Hans alone and quoted only the Prime Sinner, his old enemy, in his office. He used it, what Heilner immediately forbade. He held out his disobedience. Heilner explained that he was Giebenrath's friend and nobody had the right to forbid them to communicate with each other.

An anticipation that this would not come back, seized his bang heart and filled him with a fearful feeling of pain, until he fell asleep and grieved.</p><p>At the same hour Heilner lay a few miles away in one Wood.

Twice the old Rector spoke a few friendly words with him, also the Latin teacher and the City pastors nodded benevolently to him in the street, but actually Hans did not go to her anymore.

He was slim and had a colorless suffering face prematurely bitter mouth and too pointed chin. In all kinds He was extremely skilled at hand-crafting, and by name he had one tremendous passion for fishing, which he transferred to Hans. This did not have a fish card at that time, but they were still fishing secretly in hidden places, and if hunting is a pleasure, it is well known Poaching a treat.

The ruling of the Gerbergesellen in The pits, in the basement, in the garden and on the screeds was strange and peculiarly, the large yawning rooms were silent and as well attractive and uncanny, the mighty and surly master of the house became like a man-eater feared and shied and the liese went in the strange house like a fairy, all children, birds, cats and Little dog a protector and mother, full of kindness and full of miraculous fairy tales and song verses.</p>",

He was a little bit in this Wilderness, but he had grown tired before the miracles came, and now stood again at the mysterious dawning entrance, this time as one Excluded, in idle curiosity.</p><p>A few times Hans went to see the falcon again. He found the one there old dusk and the old evil smell, the old angles and lightless stairwells; there were old men and women again the doors and unwashed, straw-colored children were shouting around.</p>",

Everything made a pitiful and puny impression.</p><p>And once in the evening he went over to the tannery. It pulled him over the gate and the damp yard, as if in the big old house hidden his childhood, with all her lost joys.</p>",
  "page-303": "<p>Over the crooked staircase and the paved eye he came to the dark Staircase, groped its way to the screed, where the skins hung stretched, and there suddenly sucked a whole cloud with the sharp smell of leather of stormy memories.

Correctly sat on the wall the liese, had a basket of potatoes for peeling in front and a few listening children around.</p><p>Hans stopped in the dark door and listened. A large Peace filled the dwarfing Gerbergarten and the weak The sound of the river that passed behind the courtyard wall was only heard the knife of Liese crunching potato peeling and her voice, she told me.

She was quite from this world and her eyes did not look like those in the evening and to read at night in the Bible and in Goßner's Schatzkästlein care for.</p>",
  "page-319": "<p>Hans suddenly looked worried again and wished fervently that Emma wants to leave soon. She stayed there and laughed and chatted and knew every joke a quick answer, and Hans was ashamed himself and became very quiet. To deal with young girls to whom he is yours had to say was terrible anyway, and this was so alive and so talkative and made of his presence and his Shyness so little that he is unhelpful and a little offended Feeler pulled in and crept, like a stripe-striped cartwheel Slug. He kept still and tried to look like one who did bored; but he did not succeed and he went in instead Face as if someone had just died.</p><p>No one had time to pay attention to it, the least to Emma herself. you was, as Hans heard, visiting Flaigs for fourteen days, but she already knew the whole city.</p>",
  "page-320": "<p> She went up and down around, tried the new, joked and laughed a little, came back and acted as if she was busy, took the children on the Poor, given away apples and spread loud laughter and lust around ago. She called every street boy, \"Wanna eat apples?\" Then she took a beautiful, red-cheeked, stretched his hands behind his back and suggested: \"right or left?\"; but the apple was never in the right hand and only when the boys began to rant, she admitted an apple, but a smaller and green one. She also seemed over Hans taught, asked him if he was the one who always had a headache and but before he could answer he was already in another conversation Neighboring people involved.</p><p>Already Hans had in mind to squeeze and go home, there gave him Flaig the lever in the hand.</p>",
  "page-321": "<p>\"Now, you can go on a little; Emma helps you. I have to in the workshop.\"</p><p>The master left, the apprentice was commissioned with the master Most away, and Hans was alone with the Emma at the press. He bites on the teeth and managed like an enemy.</p><p>Then he wondered why the lever was so hard, and when he did looked up, the girl burst into a loud laugh. she had struggled against it for fun and when Hans now furiously dressed again, she did it again.</p><p>He did not say a word. But while he pushed the lever, which beyond the girl's body resisted, it suddenly became shy he stopped in his tracks and gradually stopped stopping to turn. A sweet fear came over him and as the young thing brashly in the face laughed, she suddenly seemed changed, friend and yet stranger, and now he too laughed a little, clumsily confidential.</p>",
  "page-322": "<p>And then the lever completely rested completely.</p><p>And Emma said, \"We do not want to scrape off like this,\" and gave him that half full glass over which she had just drunk herself.</p><p>This sip of must seemed to him very strong and sweeter than the previous one, and When he had drunk, he looked into the empty glass and asked Wondering how hard his heart was beating and how hard it was for him to breathe has been.</p><p>Then they worked a little bit again and Hans did not know what he was doing did as he tried to position himself so that the girl's skirt had to brush him and her hand touched his. As often as that happened, his heart stopped in fearful delight and came to a pleasant sweet weakness about him, that his knees trembled a little and in his Head dizzy sounded.</p>",
  "page-323": "<p>He did not know what he said, but he answered her questions, laughed when she laughed, threatening her a couple of times with her finger when she did drove dumb stuff, and drank another glass out of her hand twice. At the same time a whole army of memories passed by: Maidservants he had in the evenings with men in the front doors see a few sentences from storybooks, the kiss Hermann gave him Heilner had given at the time, and a lot of words, narratives and darken student talks about \"the girls\" and \"what's up, if you do a guess has \". And he breathed as heavily as a horse Uphill pull.</p><p>Everything was transformed. The people and the buzz around was one colored laughing cloud beings dissolved. The individual voices, curses and laughter subsided in a general dull roar, the river and the old bridge looked distant and painted.</p>",
  "page-324": "<p>Emma also had a different look. He did not see her face anymore - only the dark, happy eyes and a red mouth, white tip Teeth behind it; her figure melted and he saw only one of them</p><p>soon a shoe with black stocking over, soon a stray curly hair in the neck, sometimes into the blue cloth inside disappearing, browned, round neck, soon the tight armpits and below it the breathing waves, now a reddish translucent ear.</p><p>And after a while, she dropped the drinking glass into the tub and then stooped, and at the same time pressed her knee on the edge of the Zuber against his wrist. And he stooped too, but slower, and She almost touched her hair with his face. The hair had one faint fragrance and below, in the shadow of loose, curly curls, shone warm and brown a beautiful neck and ran into the blue Waist, whose strongly strained sticking him a bit further in the Ritz let shine through.</p>",
  "page-325": "<p>When she straightened up again and as her knee flexed his arm slid along, and her hair brushed his cheeks, and she from Bending had turned completely red, ran a violent shudder Hans through all Members. He turned pale and for a moment had the feeling of one deep, deep tiredness, so that he clings to the press screw had to. His heart went up and down and his arms became weak and weak hurt him in the armpits.</p><p>From then on he spoke almost no word and avoided the look of Girl. But he saw her, as soon as she looked away, rigid and with one Mixture of unknown pleasure and bad conscience. At this hour tore something in him and brought along a new, strangely enticing land distant blue seas rise before his soul. He did not know yet or only knew what the bangs and sweet anguish in him meant, and knew well not what was greater in him, pain or lust.</p>",
  "page-326": "<p>Lust, however, meant the victory of his young love-power and the first Ancestors of the tremendous life, and the pain meant that the morning peace was broken and that his soul had left the land of childhood, that you will not find again. His light boat, just about the first Shipwreck escaped, was now in the power of new storms and in the Near waiting shallows and breakneck cliffs advised by which also the ordered youth has no leader, but from own Forces must find a way and rescue.</p><p>It was good that now the Lehrbub returned and replaced him at the press. Hans stayed there for a while. He still hoped for a touch or a friendly word from Emma. This chatted again to strangers Pressing around. And since Hans was embarrassed by the apprentice, he squeezed to go home after fifteen minutes without saying goodbye.</p>",
  "page-327": "<p>Everything had turned out strangely different, beautiful and exciting. The of the Scarlet sparrows shot noisily through the sky, who had never been so tall and beautiful and so longing blue. The river never had such a pure, green-blue, laughing mirror still had such a dazzling white, roaring weir. Everything seemed Equally graced pictures painted behind clear, fresh glass stand. Everything seemed to be waiting for the beginning of a big party. Also in his own breast he felt a tight, strong and sweet Weighing strangely audacious emotions and unusual, glaring hopes, along with a shy, doubtful fear that it was just a dream and could never come true. Enlarging, these were ambiguous Sensations to a darkening source, to a feeling, as want to release something all too strong in him and gain air - maybe a sob, maybe a singing, screaming or a loud Laugh. Only at home did this agitation calm down a bit. There was of course everything as always.</p>",
  "page-328": "<p>\"Where did you come from?\" Asked Herr Giebenrath.</p><p>\"From Flaig to the mill.\"</p><p>\"How much did he eat?\"</p><p>\"Two kegs, I think.\"</p><p>He asked to invite the Flaigschen children when the father ans Mosten would come.</p><p>\"Understood,\" grunted Papa. \"I'll do it next week. Get her then only!\"</p><p>It was an hour until dinner. Hans went to the garden out. Except for the two firs, there was not much green left. He tore one Dizzy off, let her whiz through the air and disturbed her in the withered leaves around. The sun was already behind the mountain, its black Outline with hair-fine drawn pine tips the greenish blue, wet clear late sky intersection.</p>",
  "page-329": "<p> A gray, elongated cloud, yellowish and brownish in color, swam slowly and pleasantly as one Returning ship through the thin, golden air up the valley.</p><p>From the mature, richly colored beauty of the evening in a strange, He was strangers to him and strolled through the garden. occasionally he stopped, closed his eyes and tried Emma to introduce her to him in the press, as she did let him drink from her cup, as she got over the skid crouched and blushing had risen again. He saw her hair, her figure in a tight blue dress, her neck and dark hair brown shadowed neck, and everything filled him with desire and trembling, only He could not imagine her face anymore.</p>",
  "page-330": "<p>When the sun was down, he did not feel the coolness and felt it advancing dawn like a veil full of secrecy, for he did not know any names. For he understood that he was in the Heilbronnerin fell in love, but the work of the awakening Masculine in his blood he only vaguely understood as one unfamiliar, irritable and tired-looking condition.</p><p>At dinner he was weird, with his transformed nature to sit in the middle of the old familiar surroundings. The father, the old maid, The table and the appliances and the whole room suddenly came to him old and he saw everything with a feeling of astonishment, strangeness and Tenderness as if he had just returned from a long journey. Back then, when he was flirting with his deadly branches, he had the same people and things with the wistful superior sensation looking at a farewell, now it was a return, Astonishment, smile, re-possession.</p>",
  "page-331": "<p>One had eaten and Hans wanted to get up, as his father said in his short way: \"Do you like to become a mechanic, Hans, or Better a scribe? \"</p><p>\"Why?\" Hans asked, astonished.</p><p>\"You could join mechanic Schuler at the end of next week, or Next week at the town hall as an apprentice. Think about it neat! We'll talk about it tomorrow. \"</p><p>Hans got up and went out. The sudden question had confused him and blinded. Unexpectedly, the daily, active, fresh turned Life before him, to which he had become a stranger for months, had one alluring face and threatening face, promised and demanded. He had no real desire for the mechanic or the scribe. The strict physical work at the craft frightened him a little. There he remembered his school friend August, who had become a mechanic and he could ask.</p>",
  "page-332": "<p>As he thought about it, his ideas became dimmer and paler, the matter did not seem so urgent important. Something else drove him and busy him, he walked restlessly the hallway up and down and suddenly he took off his hat, left the House and slowly went out on the alley. It had occurred to him, he Emma has to see again today.</p><p>It was already dark. Shouting and hoarse sounded from a nearby tavern Singing over. Some windows were lit, lit here and there One and one again and put a faint red glow in the dark air. A long line of young girls, arm in arm, strolled gagged with loud laughter and talk, wavered in the uncertain light and ran through like a warm surge of youth and lust the slumbering streets. Hans watched for a long time, his heart beating up to his neck. Behind a window curtained with curtains to play the violin At the fountain, a woman washed lettuce.</p>",
  "page-333": "<p> On the bridge Two boys walked with their treasures. One held his girl Loosely by the hand, she swung her arm and smoked his cigar. The second couple went on slowly and tightly, the boy embracing the girl's hip and she pressed her shoulder and head firmly against his chest. Hans had seen this a hundred times and ignored it. Now it had a secret meaning, an unclear, but lasciviously sweet one Importance; his eyes remained on the group and his imagination urgently anticipated a close understanding. Tired and in the Startled, he felt close to a big secret, from he did not know if it was delicious or terrible, but of He felt a bit ahead of both.</p><p>He stopped in front of Flaigschen's cottage and did not find the courage enter.</p>",
  "page-334": "<p> What should he do and say inside? He had to remember how he often came here as a boy of eleven and twelve; then Flaig had told him biblical stories and his stormy curious questions about hell, the devil and the spirits withstood. These memories were uncomfortable and gave him one guilty conscience. He did not know what he wanted to do, he did not know Once what he really wanted, but he wanted to make him stand something secretive and forbidden. It seemed wrong to him To be a shoemaker, that he stood in the dark before his door, without enter. And if he saw him standing there or now out the door he would probably not even scold him, but laugh at it, and before that dreaded him the most.</p><p>He crept behind the house and could now from the garden fence in the see illuminated living room inside. He did not see the master.</p>",
  "page-335": "<p> The woman seemed to sew or knit something, the oldest boy was still up and sat reading at the table. The Emma went back and forth, apparently with Tidying up busy so that he can only see her for a few moments got. It was so quiet that you could take every farthest step in the alley and on the other side of the garden, hear the soft flow of the river clearly could. The darkness and night-time chill increased rapidly.</p><p>Next to the living room windows was a smaller hallway dark. After For a long while, there was an indistinctness in the little window Gestalt, leaned out and looked into the darkness. Hans realized the figure that it was Emma, ​​and with anxious expectation that was his Heart still. She stopped in the window, looking long and quiet, but he did not know if she saw and recognized him.</p>",
  "page-336": "<p> He did not move a member and stared straight at her, hoping with uncertain hesitation at the same time and fearing she wants to recognize him.</p><p>And the indistinct figure disappeared out of the window, right away The small garden door clicked on it and Emma came out of the house. Hans He wanted to leave in the morning, but he remained helpless at the fence leaned and saw the girl slowly towards him through the dark garden and at every step he was driven to run, and something stronger held him back.</p><p>Now Emma was standing right in front of him, not half a step away, only the one low fence in between, and she looked at him attentively and strangely. For a long time none said a word. Then she asked softly:</p>",
  "page-337": "<p>\"What do you want?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" he said, and it touched his skin like a caress, that she had told him you.</p><p>She held out her hand over the fence. He took her timidly and tenderly and squeezed her a little, then he realized that she was not was withdrawn, took courage and stroked the warm girl hand fine and careful. And when she was still willing to leave him, he put her to his cheek. A flood of penetrating pleasure, from strange warmth and blissful fatigue overflowed his nature, the air around it seemed to him lukewarm and dry, he did not see alley nor garden more, just a close, bright face and a tangle of dark hair.</p>",
  "page-338": "<p>And it seemed to sound to him from a great night away, than that Girl very softly asked:</p><p>\"Are you going to kiss me?\"</p><p>The bright face came closer, the weight of a body bent the slats little outward, loose, slightly fragrant hair brushed Hans's forehead, and closed eyes, of white, wide eyelids and dark eyelashes covered, stood close to his. A violent shudder ran him over the body as he touched the girl's mouth with shy lips. He shivered instantly, but she had his head with her clutching her hands, pressed her face into his, leaving his lips do not go. He felt her mouth burning, he felt him press on and greedily, as if he wanted to drink his life. A deep Weakness came over him; even before the strange lips left him, transformed the trembling pleasure into death-weariness and pain, and as Emma released him, he staggered, holding on with convulsive clenching Fingers on the fence stuck.</p>",
  "page-339": "<p>\"You, come back tomorrow night,\" said Emma, ​​and walked quickly into the house back. She had been gone less than five minutes, but Hans seemed long times passed. He looked at her blankly, stopping Still on the planks and feeling too tired to take a step to do. Dreaming he listened to his blood pounding in his head, in unequal, painful waves from the heart and flooded back and him Breath acted.</p>",
  "page-340": "<h3>* * * * *</h3>",
  "page-341": "<p>Now he saw inside the room go the door and the master come in who was probably still in the workshop. A fear one would like to notice him, attacked him and drove him away. He went slow, reluctant and insecure like a drunk and had a little with every step, the feeling of having to sink to your knees. The dark ones Alleys with sleepy gables and murky red window eyes flowed like pale scenes past him, and bridge, river, courtyards and gardens. Of the Gerbergaßbrunnen spluttered loud and loud. Self-conscious dream Hans opened a gate, came through a pitch dark aisle, climbed stairs up, opened and closed a door and another, sat down on one and awoke only after a long time to the Sensation of being at home in his room. It took another one A while before he decided to undress. He did it distractedly and remained undressed sitting by the window, until suddenly the Autumn night shivered and drifted into the pillows.</p>",
  "page-342": "<p>He thought he had to fall asleep immediately. But hardly was he and had gotten a little warm, so the heartbeat came again and that unequal, violent waves of blood. As soon as he opened his eyes, if it were as if the girl's mouth was still attached to his, suck him Soul and fill it with tormenting heat.</p><p>Late he fell asleep and rushed in a hunted escape from dream to dream. He stood in a fearfully deep darkness, groping his way Emma's arm, she embraced him and they sank together in a slow fall a warm, deep tide. The shoemaker suddenly stood and asked why he did not want to visit him, Hans laughed and realized that it was not Flaig, but Hermann Heilner, who was next to him in the Maulbronn oratorio sat in a window and joked.</p>",
  "page-343": "<p> But and at once that disappeared, and he stood by the cider press, Emma He braced himself against the lever and he fought it with all his might. She bent over and searched his mouth, it became quiet and pitch black and now he sank back into a warm, black depth and passed away from dizziness and dread. At the same time he heard Ephorus Speech that he did not know if it applied to him.</p><p>Then he slept until late in the morning. It was a cheerful one golden day. He paced the garden for a long time, struggling to wake up and be clear, but was of a tough, sleepy Surrounded by fog. He saw violet asters, the very last flowers of the Garden, beautiful and laughing in the sun, as if it were still in the August, and saw the warm, sweet light around the withered Reiser and Branches and bare tendrils gently and ingratiatingly flood as if it's early spring time.</p>",
  "page-344": "<p> But he just saw it, he did not experience it, it worked do not care about him. Suddenly a clear, strong memory seized him the time when his rabbits were still jumping around here in the garden Waterwheel and Hammerwerkchen ran. He had to think about a September day three years ago. It was the eve of the Sedansfest; August was closed come to him and brought ivy, now they washed theirs Flagstaffs blank and attached the ivy to the golden spikes, Talking about tomorrow and looking forward to tomorrow. Otherwise nothing was and nothing happened, but they were both so full of hardworking and big The flags had shone in the sun that Anna had Plum cake baked, and at night should on the high rock that Sedan fire are fired.</p><p>Hans did not know why he had to think of that evening, not why this memory was so beautiful and powerful, nor why it was made him so miserable and sad.</p>",
  "page-345": "<p> He did not know that in the dress of this Remember his childhood and his nubblesto once again happy and Laughing in front of him got up to say goodbye and the sting of a to leave behind past and never-returning great happiness. He only felt that memory with thinking of Emma and yesterday In the evening, he could not stand his ground and that something had risen in him, that with him the former happiness was incompatible. He believed that again golden flagpins flash to see his friend August laugh too to hear and smell the scent of fresh cakes, and that's all cheerful and blissful and so distant and alienated from him, that he leaned against the rough trunk of the large spruce tree and into one hopeless sobbing broke out, comforting him for the moment brought and granted salvation.</p>",
  "page-346": "<p>At noon he ran to August, who now became the first apprentice and had diverged and grown powerfully. He told him his Concerns about being a mechanic.</p><p>\"That's one thing,\" he said, cutting a worldly-wise one Face to it. \"That's one thing. Because you are such a Schwachmatikus are. In the first year, you always have that in forging damned beating and so'n Vorhammer is not a soup spoon. And he has to carry the irons around and clean them up in the evening, and he has to do the filing also a force, and in the beginning, until you have something going, you get nothing but old files, they do not hit anything and are as smooth as a monkey's ass. \"</p>",
  "page-347": "<p>Hans immediately became meek.</p><p>\"Yes, then I'd better leave it alone?\" He asked timidly.</p><p>\"Jerum, I did not say that! Do not be a Lamech! Just that it is not a dance floor in the beginning. But otherwise, yes - such a mechanic is what a fine thing, you know, and a good head must have one too, otherwise can he will be blacksmith. Look at it! \"</p><p>He brought in a few small, finely worked machine parts bare steel, and showed her Hans.</p><p>\"Yes, there must not be half a millimeter left. Everything by hand managed, except for the screws. That's your eyes open! They will be now polished and hardened, that's it. \"</p>",
  "page-348": "<p>\"Yes that is nice. If only I knew --\"</p><p>August laughed.</p><p>\"Afraid? Yes, a Lehrbub is just curated, because nothing helps. But I'm still here, too, and I'll help you then. And if you are on I'll start next Friday, then I'll have my second year of apprenticeship finished and get on Saturday the first weekly wage. And on Sunday will be celebrated, and beer, and cake, and everyone, you too, then you see Let's see how it is with us. Yes, you are looking! And we are yes formerly had such good friends. «</p><p>At dinner, Hans told his father that he was in the mood for a mechanic and whether he can start in eight days.</p>",
  "page-349": "<p>\"All right,\" said Dad, and went into the afternoon with Hans Schuler's workshop and registered him.</p><p>But when it began to get dusk, Hans had it all again as good as forgotten and thought only that he in the evening of the Emma is expected. It was already taking his breath away, the hours were soon too long for him and soon too short and he drove the meeting against like a skipper of a rapids. Essen was this Evening no speech, he hardly brought down a cup of milk. Then went he.</p><p>It was all like yesterday - dark, slender streets, red windows, Lantern lows and slow-moving love couples.</p><p>At the shoemaker's garden, he was overcome by a great anxiety winced at each sound and came to a standstill with his Listening in the dark like a thief.</p>",
  "page-350": "<p> He did not have a minute yet Waiting, Emma stood in front of him, running his hands over his hair and opened the garden gate for him.

The girl was in good spirits and chattering in a whisper Come on. She had already tasted a lot of kiss and knew in love things communication; the timid, tender boy was just right. She took his narrow face between her hands, kissing forehead, eyes and Bake, and when the mouth's turn came and she again so long and With a sip, kissing, he seized the boy with dizziness and he lay limply willingly leaning against her. She laughed softly and tugged at his ear.</p>",
  "page-351": "<p>She chatted on and on and he listened and did not know what he was doing heard. She ran her hand over his arm, over his hair, over his neck and hands, she leaned her cheek against his and hers Head on his armpit. He was silent and let everything happen, from a sweet horror and a deep, happy anxiety, sometimes flinching briefly and quietly like a fever.</p><p>\"What kind of a treasure are you!\" She laughed. \"You dare nothing.\"</p><p>And she took his hand and ran it over her neck and through her Hair and put her on her chest and pressed against it. He felt the soft form and the sweet strange waves, closed the eyes and felt sink into endless depths.</p>",
  "page-352": "<p>\"Not! Not anymore! \"He said defensively as they kissed him again wanted.

I'm so tired. \"</p><p>He did not feel that she supported him on the way to the garden fence pressed against him, and did not hear that she said good night and behind him the door closed. He came home through the streets, he did not know like a big storm tearing him or taking him rocking a powerful flood.</p><p>He saw pale houses to the left and right, ridges above Fir tips, night owls and big, resting stars. He felt that Blowing wind, heard the river flowing down the bridge piers and looked in Water gardens, pale houses, night owls, lanterns and stars mirrored.</p>",
  "page-354": "<p>He had to sit down on the bridge; he was so tired and did not believe more to come home. He sat down on the parapet and listened on the water that rubbed against the pillars and roared at the weir and on Mühlrechen orgelte. His hands were cold, worked in the chest and throat halting and rushing the blood, his eyes darkened and rushed back to the heart in a sudden wave, his head full of dizziness leaving.</p><p>He came home, found his room, lay down and slept at once Entering in the dream from depth to depth through immense spaces. Around At midnight he awoke tormented and exhausted and lay down to the Morning between sleep and waking, from a thirsting yearning fulfilled, thrown back and forth by uncontrolled forces, right up to the first morning all his agony and affliction in a long crying broke out and he fell asleep on tear-wet pillows again.</p>",

  "page-359": "<p> Dreams in which the unreasonable flushes of his blood to monstrous, frightening Fabled images became too hot-eyed, deadly embracing arms Imaginations, dizzy abysses, huge blazing eyes. Waking up, he found himself alone, the loneliness of the cool Autumn nights embraced, longed for his girl and squeezed moaning in tear-off pillows.</p><p>The Friday on which he was to enter the mechanic workshop came closer. The father bought him a blue linen suit and a blue, half woolen cap, he tried the stuff and came in the Locksmith uniform changed and quite ridiculous.

Everything seemed to him with Emma Desirable and close to all the spells of life and treacherous to have slipped away again. He did not think about the agony anymore Anxiety he had felt in her. If he returns her now he thought he would never be shy but everyone Snatch secrets and into the enchanted love garden penetrate, whose gate was slammed in his face now.

To At noon do you have enough to do, then you show it to me. And at At work, you do not care about anything but what you are told. Thoughts do not need to have an apprentice. «</p><p>Hans began to file.</p><p>\"Stop!\" Cried the Master. \"Not so. The left hand is so on the File laid. Or are you a leftist? \"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"All right then. It'll work. \"</p>",
  "page-366": "<p>He walked away to his vise, the first by the door, and Hans watched him get along.</p><p>At the first strokes he wondered why the stuff was so soft and went off so easily. Then he saw that it was only the topmost brittle casting bark which was peeling off loosely, and that at first there was the grainy iron, that he should smooth out. He got together and worked eagerly away. He had never had the pleasure of his playful boy-drafts tasted, under his hands something visible and useful arise to see.</p><p>\"Slower!\" Cried Master. \"When filing you have to keep pace one two, one two.

He had her all over Forgotten morning. Now suddenly the suffering of yesterday and the day before yesterday back on his neck, as hard as ever. He went quietly in his Upstairs, he threw himself on the bed and groaned in agony. He Wanted to cry, but his eyes stayed dry. He looked hopeless again surrendering to the consuming longing whose goal is dark to him and that ate him like a cruel disease. The head stormed and hurt him, and his throat ached with strangled sobs.</p>",
  "page-373": "<p>Lunch was torture. He had to speak to the father and tell stories and let all sorts of little jokes, because the daddy was in a good mood. As soon as they had eaten, he ran out into the garden and spent half an hour dreaming in the sun for a quarter of an hour, then It was time to go back to the workshop.</p><p>Already in the morning he had received red calluses on his hands, now they began to hurt seriously and were so swollen in the evening that he could not touch anything without pain. And before closing time He had to clean up the whole workshop under August's guidance.</p><p>Saturday was even worse. His hands burned him, the calluses had increased to bubbles. The master was in a bad mood and cursed at the slightest occasion.</p>",
  "page-374": "<p> August consoled, that with the If only a few days of calluses call, then you have hard hands and feel nothing more, but Hans felt miserable, squinted the whole Day after day, scratching his wheel hopelessly.</p>",

At home, he was given the old Anna an ointment for the sore hands, he went in already at eight o'clock Bed and slept until morning, so he spun He had to go to church with his father.</p><p>At lunch he started talking about August and that he was with him today over field wool.

  "page-377": "<p>As Hans strolled through the streets in the beautiful sunshine, For months he had for the first time again a pleasure on Sunday. The The road was more solemn, the sun more cheerful and all the more festive and Nicer when working days with black hands and tired limbs had behind him. He now understood the butchers and tanners, bakers and Blacksmiths sitting in front of their houses on the sunny benches and stuff He looked royally gay, and he never regarded her as miserable Philistines. He looked after workers, journeymen and apprentices who were in Walked rows or went to the inn, the hat a little crooked the head, with white shirt collar and in brushed Sunday clothes. Mostly, though not always, the craftsmen stayed below Carpenters at carpenters, bricklayers at masons, held together and kept the honor of their estate, and among them the locksmiths were the noblest guild, top of the mechanics.</p>",
  "page-378": "<p> It all had something Homely and if a little bit naive and ridiculous was, was behind it the beauty and the pride of the craft hidden, which still today is something joyful and efficient and of which the poorest tailor apprentice still one little shimmer, no factory worker and no merchant Has.</p><p>How the young mechanics stood in front of Schuler's house, calm and proud, nodding to passers-by and chatting among themselves, there could you can see that they formed a reliable community and no stranger needed, even on Sunday at the pleasure not.</p><p>Hans also felt that and was happy to be one of them. But felt he was a little afraid of the planned Sunday fun, because he knew even that it is massive and ample for the mechanics in the enjoyment of life walked. Maybe they would even dance.</p>",

He told me that though the older journeyman did not want to join, but a colleague from another workshop, at least four people and that enough to turn a whole village. Everyone can have beer today drink as much as he likes, because that's what he pays for everyone. He offered Hans one Cigar, then the four slowly set in motion, strolling slowly and proudly through the city and started at the bottom of Lindenplatz to march faster to get to Bielach in time.</p>",
  "page-380": "<p>The mirror of the river flickered blue, gold and white, through the almost completely leafy maples and acacias of street alleys warmed one mild October sun down, the high sky was cloudless light blue. It was one of the quiet, pure and friendly autumn days on which everything beautiful of the past summer like a careless, smiling one Memory fulfills the mild air that the children use the season forget and think they have to look for flowers and those old ones Little men and women with musing eyes from the window or from the window Bank in front of the house to look into the air, because it seems to them, the friendly memories not only of the year, but of their whole Expired life flies visibly through the clear blueness.</p>",
  "page-381": "<p> The young but are good and praise the good day, according to gifts and Mentality, through libations or sacrifices, through song or dance, by drinking or by great rags, because everywhere are baked fresh fruit cake, young cider or wine lies fermenting in the cellar and celebrating violin or harmonica in front of the taverns and on the Lindenplätze the last beautiful days of the year and invites to dance and song singing and lovemaking.</p><p>The young lads made rapid progress. Hans smoked his cigar with the appearance of carelessness and wondered himself that she got him well. The company told of his wanderings and no one took offense at his mouth being so full; that belonged to Thing. Even the most modest journeyman when sitting in the bread and is safe from eyewitnesses, tells of his wanderings in one great and brisk, yes fabulous tone.</p>",
  "page-382": "<p> Because the wonderful poetry The craftsmanship life is common property of the people and seals For each individual, the traditional old adventures are new with new ones Arabesques, and every penny and fencing brother has when he is telling device, a piece of the immortal Eulenspiegel and a piece of the immortal Straubinger in itself.</p><p>\"So in Frankfurt, where I was then, Sackerlot, there was still one a life!

  "page-383": "<p>And he continued to tell how the master, the bitch, had him swinging want, the miserable soul seller, and once dared and shake hands He stretched out after him, but he did not say a word, but only the word Swinging hammer and looking at the old man like that, and he is but left quietly, because his skull was dear to him, and has him then subsequently canceled in writing, the cowardly drip. And he told me about it a big battle in Offenburg, where three locksmiths, he doing seven Factory workers have beaten half dead, - who comes to Offenburg, just need to ask the long Schorsch, who is still there and is at that time.</p><p>All this was done with a cool-brutal tone, but with a great inner tone Informed zeal and pleasure and everyone listened with deep pleasure and secretly decided to add this story later to tell, elsewhere with other comrades.</p>",
  "page-384": "<p> Because every locksmith has once his master's daughter had a treasure and is once with the hammer set off on a wicked master and once has seven factory owners miserably cut through. Soon the story will be in Baden, soon in Hesse or in Switzerland, soon it was instead of the hammer the file or a hot iron, soon bakers or bakers instead of factory owners Schneider, but it's always the old stories and you hear them always happy, because they are old and good and honor the guild. Which does not mean that it is not always and today there are still those among the wandering geniuses, the geniuses in the experience or Geniuses in invention are what both are basically the same.</p><p>In particular, August was rapt and happy. He kept laughing and agreed, already felt as half a journeyman and blew with contemptible enjoyment of the tobacco smoke in the golden air.</p>",
  "page-385": "<p> And the Narrator continued to play his part because it was important to his Co-existence as a good-natured condescension, since he as Gesell actually on Sunday was not among the apprentices and himself should have been ashamed to help the boy drink his batzen.</p><p>A good stretch of road had gone down the highway; now you had the choice between a slowly rising, uphill bow leading lanes and a steep footpath, which is only half as far was. They chose the driveway, though it was long and dusty. Footpaths are for the weekday and for walking gentlemen; the people but loves, especially on Sundays, the highway, whose poetry him has not been lost yet. Climb steep footpaths, that's for Farmers or for nature lovers from the city, that's a job or a sport, but no pleasure for the people.</p>",

As little as a handyman is ever so stupid, the funny, swapping comfortable and efficient road with footpaths so little does it is the urban petty bourgeois.</p><p>So you went the track, which in a large arc quiet and friendly Berghinan moved like one who has time and loves no sweat.</p>",

That was all right, and so they went to the village, to the stables and to the with low Geranienstöcken occupied lower farmer 's windows on the \"Anchor,\" its gold shield over two young round chestnuts gliding away in the sun.

He was bankrupt but had his own house taken by his main creditor, a big beer brewer, on lease and has since become even more distinguished. The garden was one Acacia tree and a large wire mesh, made of wild wine for the time being half overgrown.</p><p>\"For good, you people!\" Shouted the journeyman, nudging the three of them.

It was nice, to laugh along and sometimes even risk a joke, it was nice and male, after drinking his glass with emphasis on the table popping and shouting carelessly, \"One more thing, miss!\" It was nice to drink to a friend at the other table, the cold cigar stump to hang in the left and push the hat in the neck like the others.</p>",
  "page-392": "<p>The accompanying stranger now began to warm up and to tell.

He had himself presumed to feed the menu of a small business and he had consumed almost everything, but at the end of the menu came four types of cheese, and as he was at the third, he pushed the cheese Plate away and said: Now rather die than another bite!</p>",

He was glad that you left now.</p><p>When the coal mine was paid and everyone stepped onto the street, Hans began to feel his three puffs a bit. It was a nice feeling half fatigue, half enterprising, too, was something like a thin one Veil in front of his eyes, through which everything is more distant and almost looked unreal, similar to how one sees in the dream. He had to be constantly laugh, had put his hat more boldly and felt like an exuberantly happy guy. The Frankfurter whistled again on his martial nature and Hans tried to go to the beat.</p>",
  "page-395": "<p>The \"sharp corner\" was pretty quiet. A few farmers drank new ones Wine. There was no open beer, only bottles, and everyone got immediately one prefixed. The strange fellow wanted to show himself noble and ordered a big apple pie for everyone. Hans felt suddenly a huge hunger and ate a few pieces in a row from that. It sat dusky and comfortable in the old brown tavern on the solid, wide wall banks.

From time to time, when conversation and laughter swelled up, he laughed out loud or said something what he immediately forgot again. When triggered, he did, and After an hour, he saw with astonishment that his bottle was empty.</p><p>\"You have a good move,\" August said. \"Do you want one more?\"</p>",

Gradually, his head hurt too.</p><p>The others, too, had done enough for good. In a clear Moment desired to pay August and got little on his thaler out.

A lot of disgusting feelings, agonizing fears and half-finished thoughts prevented him from falling asleep. He felt soiled and disgraced. How was he supposed to come home? What should he say to the father? And what should be out of it tomorrow? He felt so broken and miserable as if he had to rest for an eternity, sleep, be ashamed.
